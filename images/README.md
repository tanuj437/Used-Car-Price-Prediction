# Images for Car Price Prediction Project

This folder contains visualizations and plots that illustrate different aspects of the car price prediction project. These images provide insights into model performance, data distribution, and feature relationships. 

## Contents

### 1. MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

This plot shows the Mean Absolute Error for various models used in the car price prediction. Lower MAE values indicate better model performance.

### 2. MSE (Mean Squared Error)
<img width="139" alt="MSE_cmp" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cc4f9fa-c0d0-48df-a1d3-db11089525af">

This plot represents the Mean Squared Error for the models. It provides insights into the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

### 3. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
<img width="146" alt="RMSE_cmp" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a5ee698-a234-48a8-b140-ee276c8b509f">

The Root Mean Squared Error plot shows the square root of the Mean Squared Error. RMSE is useful for understanding the average magnitude of prediction errors.

### 4. R2 Score
