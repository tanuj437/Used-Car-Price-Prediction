## Data Attributes
The dataset contains the following attributes for each car:

- **id:** Unique identifier for each car
- **brand:** The brand of the car
- **model:** The specific model of the car
- **model_year:** The year the car model was manufactured
- **milage:** The total mileage of the car in kilometers
- **fuel_type:** The type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric)
- **engine:** The engine type of the car (e.g., V6, V8, Electric)
- **transmission:** The type of transmission in the car (e.g., Automatic, Manual)
- **ext_col:** The exterior color of the car
- **int_col:** The interior color of the car
- **accident:** Indicates whether the car has been in an accident (Yes/No)
- **clean_title:** Indicates whether the car has a clean title (Yes/No)
- **price:** The price of the car (target variable)
