## üìù Abstract
The Used Car Price Prediction project aims to estimate the price of used cars based on multiple features. By applying various machine learning models, including regression techniques and ensemble methods, the project seeks to build a robust model for predicting car prices and provide insights into the factors influencing car values.

## üîç Methodology
1. **Importing Libraries**

Essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost are imported for data manipulation, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Loading the Dataset**

The dataset contains information about used cars, including features such as brand, model, mileage, fuel type, engine type, transmission type, and more. This dataset is used to train and evaluate the prediction models.

3. **Data Preprocessing**

The preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. **Training the Models**

Multiple models are implemented, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor, K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. Each model is trained and evaluated to identify the most effective approach for predicting car prices.

5. **Model Evaluation**

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2). Visualization of results helps in comparing the effectiveness of different models.

6. **Web Application**

A Streamlit web application is developed to allow users to input car attributes and get predictions on car prices in real-time. This application utilizes the pre-trained model to provide instant price estimates.
